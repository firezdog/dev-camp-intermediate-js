OOP

Programming around classes and objects (instances)
Abstraction / modularity
JS (in earlier versions) could only mimic classes

new
1. creates empty object
2. implicit value of 'this'
3. implicit "return this" to function (so really we get back some kind of function that is linked to an object?)
4. adds __proto__ (prototype)

constructors

call / apply + constructors
